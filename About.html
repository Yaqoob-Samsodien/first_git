    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>From humble beginnings of wielding old motorcycle parts together. We at Samsodien's Motorsport have created mock
        designs on mock designs throwing in neat variations on the classic bobber motorcycle design.
        This is mzansi's first proudly created and distrubuted motorcycle company. Starting from making concepts in a
        garage
        from scap parts to having our very own dealership.Our mission was to make our dream a reality while adding our
        spririt and passion in each design.
    </p>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>We plan to be the biggest creator and distrubutor of motorcycles in South Africa, as well as putting our mark in
        the
        international circut of motorcycle distrubution.Our principles are <span class="text-success">Enginuity ,
            Performance and Style</span> as we want to bring the most quality to our country while still being
        affordable and reliable. Our designs come dfrom each passion we have and want in a bike from a nice tourist , to a cruising bobber to a reliable everyday cafe racer.
